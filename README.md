<h1><samp>WELCOME TO MY PLANET</samp></h1>

<samp>Welcome, Traveler.</samp>
<samp>You’ve entered my digital universe.</samp>

<samp>I’m Sean, also known as **Ace** -- a Writer 🎭, Gamer 🎮, and an Aspiring Computer Scientist on a mission to turn ideas into functioning systems and stories into code. I build, break, and rebuild—because that’s how evolution works.</samp>

<samp>From front-end layouts to logical problem-solving, I treat every project like a quest:</samp>

<samp>📡 Explore new technologies</samp>

<samp>🧠 Learn from errors and iterations</samp>

<samp>🛠️ Engineer solutions that actually work</samp>

<h2><samp>🧬 Current Objectives</samp></h2>

<samp>🚀 Leveling up in Web Development & Software Engineering</samp>

<samp>🧪 Experimenting with logic, design, and performance</samp>

<samp>📚 Writing code the same way I write stories—with structure, purpose, and creativity</samp>


<h2><samp>🌌 Fun Facts from This Planet</samp></h2>

<samp>I debug like it’s a boss fight</samp>

<samp>Clean UI is just as important as clean logic</samp>

<samp>I believe code is both art and weapon</samp>

<samp>“In a universe full of users, be the developer.”</samp>

<samp>These are the languages I use to communicate with machines across galaxies:</samp>
